This repository aims to develop an executable application to flash programs on esp32 with more than 1 device at same time. This application is built and tested on  Windows 10 OS and is expected to be further developed in the future.

Here is also an example of a folder with a file extension .bin that have been exported from arduino IDE(https://randomnerdtutorials.com/bin-binary-files-sketch-arduino-ide/).

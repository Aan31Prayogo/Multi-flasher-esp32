## ðŸ“‚ Example `.bin` Files

You can generate `.bin` files in Arduino IDE. Follow this [guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/bin-binary-files-sketch-arduino-ide/) to export `.bin` files for your ESP32 projects.  
An example `.bin` file folder should contain:
- **`bootloader.bin`**
- **`partitions.bin`**
- **`firmware.bin`**

Here's what the folder might look like:
/bin_files/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ bootloader.bin â”œâ”€â”€ partitions.bin â””â”€â”€ firmware.bin

## ðŸ“Š Example Output
- INFO: Successfully flashed on COM1
- INFO: Successfully flashed on COM2
- ERROR: Invalid path file on COM3
